 1):What is Java : Java is a high-level, object-oriented, platform-independent programming language. It follows the principle of "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA), meaning that Java code can run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed.
 2):What are the main features of Java:
    a:Object-Oriented: Everything in Java is treated as an object, except primitive data types.
    b:Platform Independence: Java is platform-independent because of the JVM.
    c:Multithreading: Java provides built-in support for multithreading, allowing efficient use of CPU.
    d:Garbage Collection: Automatic memory management helps avoid memory leaks.
    e:Security: Java provides a secure environment through features like bytecode verification and sandboxing.
3):What is JDK, JRE, and JVM?
    a:JDK (Java Development Kit): A full package that includes tools for developing Java applications, such as the compiler (javac) and other utilities.
    b:JRE (Java Runtime Environment): A subset of the JDK that includes only the components required to run Java applications (like JVM and libraries).
    c:JVM (Java Virtual Machine): The virtual machine that runs Java bytecode, making Java platform-independent.
4):How does Java handle memory management?
    Java handles memory management through automatic garbage collection, which reclaims memory that is no longer in use, ensuring efficient resource utilization.
5):Explain Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java.
    a:Encapsulation: Bundling the data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class).
    b:Abstraction: Hiding the implementation details and showing only the functionality.
    c:Inheritance: Mechanism where one class inherits the properties and behaviors of another class.
    d:Polymorphism: Ability for different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through inheritance or interfaces.
6):What is a package in Java?
    A package is a namespace that organizes a set of related classes and interfaces. It helps avoid class name conflicts and provides access control.
7):What is the difference between int and Integer in Java?
    int is a primitive data type, while Integer is a wrapper class that allows int to be treated as an object.
8):What is the significance of the main() method in Java?
    The main() method is the entry point of any Java application. It is where the execution of a Java program begins.
9):What is an interface in Java?
    An interface is a reference type in Java that defines a set of abstract methods. A class that implements an interface must provide implementations for all its methods.
10):What is the this keyword in Java?
The this keyword refers to the current instance of a class. It is commonly used to differentiate between class fields and parameters when they have the same name.
